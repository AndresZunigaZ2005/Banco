	(e.g. <span font="fixed">com.example.foo</span>). The last segment of this
	name has special meaning for the chosen project template:</p>
	<li>
		<span font="fixed">*.example</span>
		— Create an example project with some stub code that demonstrates
		the key features of OSGi enRoute, like multiple bundles in one project,
		executable jars,
		debug configurations, etc. Choose this to play with bndtools/enRoute.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span font="fixed">*.api</span>
		— Create an API project. Use this when you have a service API that
		should be shared
		with others, i.e. it must be releasable as a separate bundle.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span font="fixed">*.provider</span> or <span font="fixed">*.adapter</span>
		— Create a provider project. Use this when you create an
		implementation
		of a service specification.

	<li>
		<span font="fixed">*.test</span>
		— Create an OSGi JUnit test project.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span font="fixed">*.application</span>

		little
		or no code but defines configuration, web pages, and dependencies.
	</li>
	<li>
		<span font="fixed">*.webresource</span>
		— Create a project that will hold a <span font="italic">web resource</span>. A web resource holds the resources for CSS, Javascript, etc.
